TODO
🏗 Add Store for Todos. Needs Cleanup, but it is working :)

Add CSS fanciness to mark todos as completed
Save to localStorage
Save to database
GraphQL
Authentication Login/Sign up
Todos completed and deleted. I have a classCompleted that can be simplified with just the properties of the todo

DONE
✅ Count works with a store
✅ Delete by clicking on an icon on the left or right
✅ Update by clicking on the todo itself
✅ Code split
✅ Split todo list as did with the input
✅ Mark as completed but leave in place - line through (Unhappy with the logic)
✅ Mark as completed and move to completed todos and back.
