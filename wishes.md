TODO
🏗 Add Store.  Started working on the Store.  I copied the functions as they are in the store.  the writable object can contain my todos array?  I have to try and see if the data can live there for now... maybe that is just the current todo... not sure.


Add CSS fanciness to mark todos as completed
Save to localStorage
Save to database
GraphQL
Authentication Login/Sign up

DONE
✅ Delete by clicking on an icon on the left or right
✅ Update by clicking on the todo itself
✅ Code split
✅ Split todo list as did with the input
✅ Mark as completed but leave in place - line through (Unhappy with the logic)
✅ Mark as completed and move to completed todos and back.
