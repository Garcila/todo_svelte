TODO
🏗 add colour to each todo. Will resemble categories

- Find a style to go for CSS. Will go for Neumorphism as in Figma's design kit
- SVG transitions could help add flare to completed or deleting a todo
- Transition events
- Maybe js transitions to cross the todo letter by letter...CSS transitions

- Add CSS fanciness - Tweened can accomplish the linethrough easily... I think... not really :)

Save to database.... Supabase seems like an interesting alternative - https://supabase.io/new -

look at class:selected="{current === 'foo'}" on:click="{()=> current = 'foo'}" https://svelte.dev/tutorial/classes

Delete branches :)

DONE
✅ Save to localStorage
✅ Animate directive to move todos from todo to completed area
✅ Count works with a store
✅ Delete by clicking on an icon on the left or right
✅ Update by clicking on the todo itself
✅ Code split
✅ Split todo list as did with the input
✅ Mark as completed but leave in place - line through (Unhappy with the logic)
✅ Mark as completed and move to completed todos and back.
✅ Todos completed and deleted. I have a classCompleted that can be simplified with just the properties of the todo
