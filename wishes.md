TODO
🏗

- Find a style to go for CSS. Will go for Neumorphism as in Figma's design kit
- SVG transitions could help add flare to completed or deleting a todo
- Transition events
- Maybe js transitions to cross the todo letter by letter...CSS transitions

- Add CSS fanciness - Tweened can accomplish the linethrough easily... I think... not really :)

Todos completed and deleted. I have a classCompleted that can be simplified with just the properties of the todo

DONE
✅ Save to localStorage
✅ Animate directive to move todos from todo to completed area
✅ Count works with a store
✅ Delete by clicking on an icon on the left or right
✅ Update by clicking on the todo itself
✅ Code split
✅ Split todo list as did with the input
✅ Mark as completed but leave in place - line through (Unhappy with the logic)
✅ Mark as completed and move to completed todos and back.
